-NOTE!!-
    •Program will not recognize bigram with character in between, otherwise program works as assigned.

    •First file must be entered via command prompt argument upon running program.

    •WARNING: Some text files have blank string delineator characters at the end of each line which will mess with calculations.
    Copy and paste file contents over themselves if this happens, or make sure text file is plain text.
    (I tried to get rid of this error but it would not go away: SEE LINE 65)
